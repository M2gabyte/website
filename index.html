                        <p>You are here because you volunteered. Everyone volunteers eventually. Your role is the same as it has always been.</p>

                        <p>Each day begins at the same time it ended. Follow the corridors. Do not deviate. The doors that were open yesterday may not exist tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>You will encounter others. They are like you. They are not you. Maintain appropriate distance. Eye contact is discouraged after the first hour.</p>

                        <p>Time here functions correctly. If you notice discrepancies, you are mistaken. Your watch is wrong. It has always been wrong.</p>
